# Photon

The photografy can be something very deep, some pictures can make you feel better, worst, or even change your mind. I wanted to make this project, to show something different.
A searching website of photos that can make you emotional 

About the project, I'm using the Pexels Api, an Api that allow you to look for a category of pictures that you like. In a code level I Start using async code:

- Fetch 
- Async await 

I've learnt a lot with this project while I feel more comfortable coding with Vanilla Js.
